It allows\napps using bunyan to log directly to the console or file in human readable format instead of as JSON without having to\nrun or pipe into the bunyan tool. This is useful for working with IDEs which do not have the ability to pipe console\noutput to another application (such as WebStorm).\n\nThis library is only really meant for development and should not be used on production environments.\n\n# Usage\n\n  ```javascript\n  var bunyan = require('bunyan');\n  var PrettyStream = require('bunyan-prettystream');\n\n  var prettyStdOut = new PrettyStream();\n  prettyStdOut.pipe(process.stdout);\n\n  var log = bunyan.createLogger({\n          name: 'foo',\n          streams: [{\n              level: 'debug',\n              type: 'raw',\n              stream: prettyStdOut\n          }]\n  });\n  ```\n\n# Tests\n\nRunning unit tests requires `mocha` installed.\n\n  ```bash\n  make test\n  ```\n\n## Coverage\n\n  ```bash\n  make coverage\n  ```\n\n# License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[bunyan]: https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan\n\n",
